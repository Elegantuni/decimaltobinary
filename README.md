# decimaltobinary
Will work on 32 bit binary numbers and lower <br />
<br />
If this is implemented in python you can use greater than 32 bit binary numbers <br />
<br />
Example usage:<br />
Convert 1 to 32 bit binary number and store in int buffer1[32]: <br />
dectobin(1, buffer1, 32) <br />
<br />
Convert -2 to 5 bit binary number and store in int buffer1[5]: <br />
dectobin(-2, buffer1, 5) <br />
